INS Version 0.7 Date: 11/9/2015
Version: 0.7.110915

This version is compatible with ACE3 and CBA_A3.
Had to do some work around in the MHQ module to be compatible with ACE3.

TODO:
 - service script needs to work through addAction instead of being automatic when entering the trigger area.
 - callToPrayer module
 - suicide bomber module
 - enemy module (implement when moving away from ALiVE)
 - Arma 3 Revive system (implement when totally vanilla)

GOAL: Make mission totally vanilla and not dependent on anything.
